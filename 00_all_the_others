# ================================================================
# ðŸ“Š CASES â€“ OPEN CASES METRICS (MONTHLY + TOUCHED)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Author: Leon Mihaescu
# Date:   2025-10-26
# Context:
#   These dimensions and measures identify and count "open" cases
#   based on lifecycle stages from `status_display`. They are used
#   in operational dashboards to measure live workload and activity.
#
# Includes:
#   â€¢ is_open_case â†’ flags active lifecycle statuses
#   â€¢ count_open_cases_this_month â†’ open cases started this month
#   â€¢ open_and_touched_this_month â†’ open cases updated/created this month
#   â€¢ count_open_cases_touched_this_month â†’ open + touched count
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Inherits fields from `cases` via `extends: [cases]`
#   - Requires valid `status_display`, `start_raw`, and `updated_raw`
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Group Label: Lifecycle â€“ Open Status
